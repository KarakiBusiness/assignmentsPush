What you’ll have to learn: In the course of building this project. I will have to first design the app repectively to the languages that we pruposed to use as a group. In this case I will have to review and update myself with the supposed languages. As these languages are Java and we are using Visual Studio, I will also have to learn how to use this difference of an IDE.
